# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
Version control is a way software developers keep track of changes.
It is useful because it makes it easier to keep track of changes to 
different systems all at once. Without version control, collaborating with other programmers would be extremely complicated and difficult.

* What is a branch and why would you use one?
A branch is taken from the repository and is then used to make changes, which can later be merged back into the parent repository.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
A commit is when changes are saved to the repo. A good commit message should be thorough, and explain what changes were made in order to avoid future confusion.

* What is a merge conflict?
A merge conflict is when two or more files that are being merged directly contradict each other in a way that the computer cannot process, therefore requiring a programmer to go in and manually fix it in order to be able to merge the files.
